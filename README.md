Repository: `Cowlsly/cowlsly-console-simple-settings-app`  
Active and only branch: `root`

Cowlsly Simple Settings is the shared Android settings module and basic control shell for the Cowlsly Console suite.

Cyberpunk UI follows the Cowlsly design language: neon glass panels over the **forever-turning cog machine** background. Reusable artwork is consumed from the canonical UI asset repository; local copies are generated platform resources.

## Current status

**Phase 1 complete**: Android app in `app/` with paged settings panels, search, usage-based ordering, and Phase 1 features for volume, CASMEA entry, and the developer gate. Build with **Java 21**:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java-21 ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The complete reusable asset set is canonical in `Cowlsly/cowlsly-ui-assets-and-data-files`: eight icons, five volume-step controls, compact PNG and SVG logos, and the animated cog-machine SVG background. Original SHA-256 values and byte identity are recorded there. Existing local paths are generated consumer copies and remain until deterministic sync and a final Java 21 build confirm safe cleanup.

## What Simple Settings is

One app. One scroll. The settings you need most are closest to you at the top: volume, tint, security, and privacy. Regular device setting categories follow, with developer options opened only after access is granted.

- **Closest**: volume, mute, panel tint, hearing-safe steps
- **Security & privacy**: PIN, biometrics, permissions, privacy dashboard
- **Personal**: profile plus CASMEA medical-information entry, edited only here
- **Device**: Wi-Fi, display, sound, storage, battery, apps, notifications, accounts through system intents
- **Developer**: gated section with PIN re-entry and Android Developer Options
- **Guardian proposals**: visible risk review and recommendation for privileged actions
- **Anchor verification**: the human Anchor gives the final explicit YES or NO before execution

See `dev/dat/doc/SIMPLE_SETTINGS_VISION.md` for the full design.

## Guardian and Anchor trust model

The Guardian is a reviewer, not an authority. It examines a proposed privileged action, identifies requested permissions, risk, evidence, warnings, reversibility, and expected effects, then returns a recommendation.

The Anchor is the final human authority. The shell must present the Guardian's complete proposal and recommendation to the Anchor and request an explicit **YES** or **NO** decision. A recommendation must never be treated as approval.

Required flow:

```text
Agent or module creates proposal
        ↓
Guardian reviews and recommends
        ↓
Anchor sees action, reason, permissions, risk, evidence, and warnings
        ↓
Anchor verifies YES or NO
        ↓
YES: execute only the approved proposal
NO: stop without side effects
```

Security invariants:

1. Every privileged, sensitive, destructive, external-app, account, security, privacy, payment, developer, or data-export action begins as a proposal.
2. The Guardian may recommend approval, denial, or revision, but cannot authorise execution.
3. Only the authenticated Anchor can issue the final decision.
4. Missing, expired, ambiguous, failed, or unavailable verification means denial by default.
5. Approval is bound to one immutable proposal version. Any material change requires a new review and new Anchor decision.
6. The decision, proposal digest, Guardian recommendation, approval method, timestamp, result, and failure state are recorded in a local audit trail without storing secrets.
7. No AI, plugin, background service, developer shortcut, or other module may bypass or simulate Anchor approval.
8. The Anchor can cancel before execution and revoke future permissions or standing approvals.

The first testable implementation may use an on-screen YES/NO gate. PIN, biometric, trusted-device, and other verification methods are later layers, not substitutes for the explicit decision.

## Phase 1 shipped

- Volume control with safe-listening steps from 0 to 90 percent and a hearing warning.
- CASMEA information entry screen using `CasmeaContentProvider` for repo 02.
- Developer shortcut with PIN re-entry, Shizuku guidance, and system developer intents.

## Canonical UI asset source

Reusable Cowlsly UI assets come from `Cowlsly/cowlsly-ui-assets-and-data-files` on active branch `root`. This repository declares pinned canonical paths in `ui_asset_dependencies.json`; generated assets and Android resources must not be edited manually. See `UI_ASSET_SOURCE.md`.
